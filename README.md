# Optimizing COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution

## Abstract
Quantum annealing finds the global minimum of an objective function over a set of states. In this project, we model COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the state of Texas a graph and seek to minimize the average distance an individual must travel to a vaccine center.
